Bone Name,Descriptions
Atlas,the Atlas is the first cirvical vertebra (C1)  and forms the connection between the base of the skull and the spinal column.
Axis,"the axis  serves as a pivot point which allows the skull to rotate on the rest of the cervial spine, it articulates superiorly with the Atlas."
Ethmoid,The Ethmoid bone separates the nasal cavity from the brain. It is located between the two orbits
sphenoid,"the Sphenoid bone is a central bone of the skull. It sits posterior to the orbitals and has been described as having a "" wing like"" or butterfly like""  shape. "
volmer Bone,the Volmer bone lies at the mid-saggital plane and forms the posterior part of the nasal septum.
Frontal Bone,The Frontal bone is anterior to both parietal bones. There is no break in the frontal bone across the mid-saggital plane. It froms what is commonly known as the forhead.
Left Inferior Nasal Concha,The Inferior Nasal Concha forms the lateral wall of the nasal cavity.
Left Lacrimal Bone,The Lacrimal bone forms the anterior part of the medial wall of the orbit.
Left Maxilla,The maxilla froms the roof of the mouth. It articulates medially and anteriorly with the nasal bones
Left Nasal Bone,The nasal bones articulate medially with each other and laterally with the maxilla
Left Palatine Bone,the palatine bone is posterior to the maxilla
Left Temporal Bone,the Temporal bone houses the structures for the organs of hearing. Its also articulates inferiorly with the mandibal forming the TMJ
Left Zygomatic Bone,the zygomatic bone articulates with the temporal bone posteriorly; the maxila anteriorly; and the frontal bone superiorly. 
Left Parietal Bone,the Parietal bone is one of the largest bones of the skull by surface area. Its most medial edge touches the mid-saggital plane.   It articulates laterally with the temporal bone and anteriorly with the frontal bone
Occipital Bone,The Occipital bone forms the base of the skull. Its defining feature is a large hole known as the Foramen Magnum through which the spinal cord passes.
Perpendicular Plate of Ethmoid,the perpendicular plate of the Ethmoid bone lies on the mid-saggital plane and divides the nasal cavity into right and left halves; lies anterior and superior to the volmer bone. 
Right Inferior Nasal Concha,The inferior Nasal Concha forms the lateral wall of the nasal cavity.
Right Lacrimal Bone,the Lacrimal bone is the smallest and most fragile bone of the face.
Right Maxilla,The maxilla froms the roof of the mouth. It articulates laterally with the zygomatic bone
Right Nasal Bone,The nasal bones form the superior portion of the nose. They
Right Palatine Bone,the palatine bone is commonly termed the hard palate. It lies anterior to the sphenoid bone.
Right Temporal Bone,the Temporal bone is inferior and lateral to the parietal bone.
Right Zygomatic Bone,The zygomatic bone commonly known as the cheek bone is the most lateral bone of the skull. 
Right Parietal Bone,the Parietal bone forms the superior and posterior portion of the skull. It articulates inferiorly with the occipital bone
the mandible,the mandible spans from one temporal bone to the other and houses the bottom teeth
left scapula,the left scapula is lateral to the zygomatic bone. It articulates with the Humerus
right iIllium,the illium articulates medially with the sacrum
left patella,The patella transfers load from the quadriceps to the tibia through the patellar tendon
left Calcaneus,the Calcaneus is inferior to the axis and is distal to the patella
sternum,the sternum is anterior to the nasal bone and inferior to the mandible
